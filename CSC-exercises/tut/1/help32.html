<h1>ROOT Exercise I - Help Level 2</h1>
<p>Got stuck? This might help even more:</p>
<h2>2 Constructors and alike</h2>

<div class="exercise">
We continue to use <a href="test_motorcycle.C" class="source">test_motorcycle.C</a>.
      As you can see the macro has a bug - instead of five motorcycles it only displays one kind
      of motorcycles. Fix that!
</div>

<p>The TMotorcycle class is stored by the variable <tt>mybike</tt>.
<tt>mybike</tt> gets passed as argument to the <tt>setproperties(mybike, brand, model, cap, power)</tt> function.
Inside this function, as the actual object is passed in argument, everything happening in the function
is NOT applied to the original object, but on a local copy of it (see scope).</p>

<p>As the lecture describes, you will have to pass a pointer to the TMotorcycle object <tt>mybike</tt>
and use the pointer inside the function to really change the original object itself.
<p>Remember that by using pointers (<tt>TMotorcycle*</tt> in this case) you should use e.g. 
<tt>mybike-&gt;SetBrand(brand)</tt> to call a function on it (note the "arrow"!).</p>
