<h1>ROOT Exercise I - Help Level 2</h1>
<p>Got stuck? This might help even more:</p>
<h2>1 Scopes</h2>

<div class="exercise">
Run the macro <a href="histogram.C" class="source">histogram.C</a>.
It is supposed to display a histogram, but something is wrong.
Fix the macro so the histogram gets displayed.
</div>

<p>The histogram is stored by the variable <tt>h1</tt>.
<tt>h1</tt> gets out of scope when the function returns, right after the histogram is drawn.
By going out of scope it is destructed, the histogram is gone.</p>

<p>As the lecture describes, you will have to create the histogram on the heap for it to survive the end-of-scope.
Look at the function <tt>sqroot</tt> in the code to see how to create an object on the heap.<p>
<p>Remember that objects on the heap are (usually) referenced by pointers (<tt>TH1F*</tt> in this case) and that you should use e.g. <tt>h1-&gt;Draw()</tt> to call a function on it (note the "arrow"!).
