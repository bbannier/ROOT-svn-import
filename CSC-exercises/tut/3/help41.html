<h1>ROOT Exercise III - Help Level 1</h1>
<p>Got stuck? This might help:</p>
<h2>2 PROOF</h2>

<div class="exercise">
<p>That worked, and it was faster - but it wasn't impressively fast.
	  What about running the same selector on a whole cluster?
	  We have set up a PROOF cluster for you: it uses one core of all the exercise machines.
	  Depending on when you get here the PROOF cluster might be pretty busy or completely empty,
	  and you will get a performance improvement that depends on the available resources.</p>
	  <p>So let's run it! The PROOF master is called <tt>"server"</tt>. Any speed difference?</p>
</div>

<p>The lecture tells you how to initialize a PROOF session. You will need to give the master as an argument.
Don't forget to tell the <tt>TChain</tt> to use PROOF for <tt>Process()</tt>.
And yes, that's of course also in the lecture.</p>
<p>If you have a problem connecting to the PROOF server please try again.
If the problem persists we might have to restart the server... so let us know!</p>
